# Hands-on Vue.js

 Base repository for the Vue.js hands-on : Vue-philosophers.
 
 The goal of this workshop is to create a small Web application that lists the great philosophers 
 (eg: Moss from IT Crowd, Sheldon Cooper from Big Bang Theory, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Jeff Goldblum, etc ...)
 and displays their best-known quotes.
  
 The workshop is for beginners. It is accessible to frontend developers who want to discover Vue.js
 or backend developers who rarely use JS on the frontend side. All you need to know is a minimum of HTML / CSS and
 the basic syntax of JS.
 
 ## Technical prerequisites
 Have recent versions of Node, NPM or Yarn installed.
 
 Your favorite code editor. It can be interesting to install the Vue.js plugins for your IDE, if it exists, 
 but it is absolutely not essential.
 
 ## Workflow of the workshop
 This repository is organised in branch (`step00`, `step01`, `step02`, ...). 
 
 Each step corresponds to an exercise on a particular theme with the instructions in the README. The steps follow 
 each other to finish on a complete application. At each step we give a solution from the previous step, but ideally 
 you start with the branch `step01` and you unroll the workshop to the end on this branch.
 
 To begin :
 
 ```bash
 # Clone the repository
 git clone [name_of_the_repository]
 
 # First exercise
 git checkout step00
 
 # Read the README instructions for the current step. 
 
 ```
