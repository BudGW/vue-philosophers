# Hands-on Vue.js

Base repository for the Vue.js hands-on : Vue-philosophers.
 
The goal of this workshop is to create a small Web application that lists the great philosophers 
(eg: Moss from IT Crowd, Sheldon Cooper from Big Bang Theory, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Jeff Goldblum, etc ...)
and displays their best-known quotes.

The workshop is for beginners. It is accessible to frontend developers who want to discover Vue.js
or backend developers who rarely use JS on the frontend side. All you need to know is a minimum of HTML / CSS and
the basic syntax of JS.

## Technical prerequisites
Have recent versions of NodeJS (> 8.x), NPM or Yarn installed.

Have Git installed.

Your favorite code editor. It can be interesting to install the Vue.js plugins for your IDE, if it exists, 
but it is absolutely not essential.

You can also install Vue.js plugins for Chrome or Firefox, these are great tool in debug and it helps to understand what
happens in your component.

Have Java or Docker install in order to run a small backend application.

## Workflow of the workshop
Checkout the `start` branch, it contains the READMEs for each steps. If you are stuck with a step or simply want to restart
from a clean state you can checkout a commit matching the solution of a specific step. Notice that the `master` branch contains
the final application.

To begin :

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/BudGW/vue-philosophers.git

# First exercise
git checkout start

# Read the README_STEP_00 instructions. 

```
